# Ball-In-A-Maze
This game has been made with pygame + pyOpenGL.
This is a labyrinth-style game. Based on left, right, up, down arrow keys press, the ball gains an angular velocity and move along the path.

## How to run
I've used Linux Mint 21 Vanessa and python version 3.10.6 to develop this game. I've tested this game on Linux Mint 21 only.

<pre><code>```bash
# setup virtual environment
python -m venv ~/.venv/pygame
source ~/.venv/pygame/bin/activate
# install all dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```</code></pre>
